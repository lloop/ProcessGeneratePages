-- The Big Things
    - Be able to export and import the database. Put this option on the field config tab.
     Also add a popup tha asks if the user wants to backup the database and user id number
     when the module is uninstalled.
     Prompt for the option that the module user be left so that in the future the auto generated pages can be deleted?
     Maybe an option to leave the module user and a check on module install that if a module
     user exists already it doesn't have to create one
    - install check for a previous module user and if it exists use that
    - Add to the database when new fields are added to a template.(also when a new template
     is created with fields automatically.
    - Some kind of cache for the folder structure so that everytime a save or
     generate function is executed you don't have to drill back down through the folder
     structure to the one you were just using
    - Work out how to have the config input field module not show up in the module manager
        (take it out of being a module and make it a class??? )
    - The date configs should have an option to reference another date filed in that template
        When the pulldown selcts another date field then the date field references the field with
        a range of time representing the possibility of how long the event would be
        from that satrt/reference date

- work on publish from date

- on repeats sometimes you have a probaility on the repeat itself and then probability on the
    sub fileds and they should be automatic if the repeat is generated

- refine the font size and placement in the image generation

- date fields should have an option to use today and a refernce from today (both backwards and forwards)

- Arrange for all installed languages to generate content also.
    Set a checkbox on the generate page to choose the option to add language capapbility

- ??? When the plugin is uninstallled have it automatically generate a recovery file. That file has the field configs
        and it also records the DB ID of the modules user acoount in order to be able to delete pages
        that were created previously. In the module automatically check an array of user IDs ti delete
        PROBLEM - The old user IDs will be able to be used by PW so you might delete good pages.
        Maybe script something to change old generated pages' user id numbers to the new one on install.


- Figure out how to get past the time limit when generating alot of pages
     Can use set_time_limit(); to reset the time limit so do pages in batches of 10 or so and reset at end
